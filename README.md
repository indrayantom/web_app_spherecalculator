My first simple web app that calculates volume, surface area, and radius of a sphere. The app was created by python using streamlit library and deployed using Heroku. This mini-project was done to gain basic understanding of Python functions and data types. I took it a step further, however, by combining all of those in a simple web application to also learn web deployment.

## Library needed
As explained before, you need to install streamlit library first.
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
And call it in your .py file 
```python
import streamlit as st
import math
```
Kudos to streamlit üëç, because the instructions or documentations on how to use them are very well written. View it [here](https://streamlit.io/).
